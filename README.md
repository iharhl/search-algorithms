# Search algorithms

Testing of following search algorithms: linear, jump, binary and ternary search.

Benchmarking is done through Timer class. Constructor initiates the timer, while destructor calculates the time since start and writes to a varible passed by reference to constructor (acting like a return).

Output is written to a console. In addition, sciplot library is used to plot the results onto a graph, which will pop up upon program finishes its execution.
